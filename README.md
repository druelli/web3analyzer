Web3-project analysis for credibility, transparency, and compliance
Web3Analyzer is a fully automated Web-3 due-diligence engine that screens project web pages and white-papers, then delivers a structured credibility score within minutes. 

It analyses team transparency, regulatory compliance, partnerships and more to highlight both red flags and strengths in a single report.


*Three-phase workflow – separate website scrape, white-paper scan and merged summary produce five detailed sub-reports plus one overall rating, so users see exactly if the project is serious.
*Trust-indicator model** – scoring buckets for Transparency (max 32 pts), Verification (10 pts) and Compliance (17 pts) give an at-a-glance risk profile.
*Outputs – downloadable PDF/Google-Doc reports.

Typical use cases range from pre-launch audits for developers and investor due-diligence to exchange listing checks and RegTech automation. Documentation lives on GitBook for quick integration guides and reference schemas
